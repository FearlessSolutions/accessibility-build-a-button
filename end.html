    <h1>The end!</h1>
    <p>
        Congratulations, you made it to the end of the workshop! This was definitely the very basics
        of making accessible widgets, but I hope you learned something along the way. If all your tests
        are passing via <b>npm run all-verify</b>, give yourself a pat on the back!
