    <h1>Exercise 2 - Click!</h1>
    <p>A button that can't be clicked isn't much of a button is it?</p>
    <p>
        In this exercise, you'll just need to capture the <b>onClick</b> event and re-emit it.
        This will be important later, as you don't want the component to fire the click event every
        time it's clicked! Think about why that might be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Don't forget to use some form of <code>preventDefault()</code> to stop the event from bubbling! If you're not familiar
        with event handling and emission in Vue, you can read up on it <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/events.html" target="_blank">here (event handling)</a>
        and <a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components-custom-events.html" target="_blank">here (event emission)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        To check how you did, just run <b>npm run exercise-2-verify</b>.
