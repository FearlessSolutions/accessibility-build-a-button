    <h1>Exercise 1 - If it looks like a button...</h1>
    <p>...and acts like a button, it's probably a button.</p>
    <p>
        The first step is to take a component and make it look like a button. You'll be using the same code
        for your button throughout this workshop, so get creative! You can find a skeleton for your button
        under <b>src/custom-button.js</b>. The stylesheet for your component can be found at <b>src/custom-button.scss</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        All we'll be checking for here is whether or not you've applied the "custom-button" class to the top-level div
        of the custom-button. We're not grading for looks ðŸ˜‰. When you want to test if you got it right, just run
        <b>npm run exercise-1-verify</b>.

    <p>Your component is rendered here:</p>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script type="module">
        import Vue from "vue/dist/vue";
        import CustomButton from "../../custom-button";

        new Vue({
            el: "#app",
            template: `
                <custom-button></custom-button>
            `,
            components: {
                CustomButton,
            }
        });
    </script>
