    <h1>Exercise 3 - Focus!</h1>
    <p>
        Here's where accessibility stuff starts to come into play. Your button currently can't be reached or activated easily by
        someone with a visual disability. Why is that? Well, when assistive tech users are using the page, they don't tend to use
        the mouse to navigate the page, they do it both with their screen reader and with the keyboard!
    </p>
    <p>
        If you have access to a screen reader such as NVDA or VoiceOver (which has a really good tutorial, by the way) I recommend
        trying to navigate the page using that and trying to get to your button using the TAB key. Notice that you're able to tab
        to the real button and the links on the page, but not your custom button.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this exercise, you'll make it so you can actually tab to your custom button! This can be done by adding your custom button
        into what's called the <b>tab order</b>. To do this, just add a <code>tabindex="0"</code> attribute on the top-level div tag
        in the custom button and you'll be able to tab to it! You can check you got it right with <b>npm run exercise-3-verify</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although we won't be testing for it, try your hand at customizing the focus state for your button. The button enters this
        focus state when you've tabbed to it and it is "focused". You can select this state in CSS with the <b>:focus</b> pseudo-class.
