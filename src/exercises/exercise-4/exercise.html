    <h1>Exercise 4 - But does it sound like a button?</h1>
    <p>
        If you tested the previous exercise with NVDA or VoiceOver, you may have noticed that when you focused the
        real button the screen reader actually read off that it was a button, but when you focused your custom button
        that it just read the text content or something.
    </p>
    <p>
        If someone depends on a screen reader, that's all they're going to hear and they won't understand that what they're
        focused on is, in fact, supposed to be a button. We'll fix that in this exercise.
    </p>
    <p>
        Screen readers can actually be told that your custom button is a button. This is done with what's called an
        <b>ARIA Role</b>. There are many different kinds of roles, such as <code>checkbox, slider, option,</code> and
        <code>tab</code>. MDN has a good list of others <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Techniques" target="_blank">here</a>.
        The one you'll need to specify in this exercise is <code>button</code>. (Couldn't see that one coming!)
    </p>
    <p>
        Try adding the attribute <code>role="button"</code> to your custom button, then try focusing it again while
        using NVDA or VoiceOver. The screen reader should now report that your button is, in fact, a button. You can check
        you got it right with <b>npm run exercise-4-verify</b>.
