# Accessibility Workshop - Build a Button

This is an accessibility workshop that explains how to build an accessible button
from scratch! It tries to stay as close to native HTML as it can, so you can apply
what you learn to other frameworks, although it does try to make the experience nicer
with the use of [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) on 
[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for snappy feedback.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the code to your local machine.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start Vite, then access the workshop at
   [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
